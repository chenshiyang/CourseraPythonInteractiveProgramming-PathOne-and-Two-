Question 1
Which of the following expressions corresponds to a dictionary with no elements?

Answer: {}    dict()

Question 2
Given an existing dictionary favorites, what Python statement adds the key "fruit" to this dictionary with the corresponding value "blackberry"?

Answer: favorites["fruit"] = "blackberry"

Question 3
Keys in a dictionary can have which of the following types?

Answer:
Strings   Tuples  Booleans

Question 4
Values in a dictionary can have which of the following types?

Answer: Lists Numbers Strings Booleans

Question 5
We often want to loop over all the key/value pairs in a dictionary. Assume the variable my_dict stores a dictionary. One way of looping like this is as follows:

for key in my_dict:
    value = my_dict[key]
    бн
However, there is a better way. We can instead write the following:

for key, value in ???:
    бн

What code should replace the question marks so that the two forms are equivalent? Refer to the video on dictionaries or the CodeSkulptor documentation.  
Answer: my_dict.items()


Question 6
Conceptually, the purpose of a dictionary is to represent a relationship between two collections of data бк each key in the dictionary 
is related to one value. Which of the following situations are instances of such a relationship?

Do not include situations where you have to introduce additional information in order to fit them into such a relationship.

Answer: Storing a sensor's data samples and the time of each sample
Storing where each person lives

Question 7
Assume we have the following definition:

def is_even(number):
    """Returns whether the number is even."""
    return number % 2 == 0
Which of the following will compute a list of all of the even elements of list my_list?

Answer: [number for number in my_list if is_even(number)]
[n for n in my_list if is_even(n)]

Question 8
You have the following code. The goal is to display a portion of the image, rescaling it to fill the canvas.

import simplegui

frame_size = [200, 200]
image_size = [1521, 1818]

def draw(canvas):
    canvas.draw_image(image, image_size,
                      [image_size[0] / 2, image_size[1] / 2],
                      [frame_size[0] / 2, frame_size[1] / 2],
                      frame_size)

frame = simplegui.create_frame("test", frame_size[0], frame_size[1])
frame.set_draw_handler(draw)
image = simplegui.load_image("http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-assets/gutenberg.jpg")

frame.start()

Answer: The source arguments in draw_image are incorrect. We are trying to load pixels that are not within the image, and thus the draw fails.

Question 9
Write a CodeSkulptor program that loads and draws the following image:

http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-assets/alphatest.png
with a source center of [220, 100] and a source size of [100, 100]. What one word appears in the canvas? If a letter is capitalized in the image, enter it as a capital.

Note that you do have to position the image as stated to see the correct word.
