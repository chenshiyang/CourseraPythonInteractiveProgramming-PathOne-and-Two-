Question 1
Let's define a class for 2-dimensional points.

class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def translate(self, deltax = 0, deltay = 0):
        """Translate the point in the x direction by deltax
           and in the y direction by deltay."""
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    бн
Which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the Point2D initializer and its 
translate method? For your first attempt at this problem, we suggest 
that you try to answer without using CodeSkulptor.

point = Point2D(3, 9)
point.translate(5, -2)

point1 = Point2D(3, 9)
point2 = Point2D()
point2.translate(20, 4)


Question 2
Let's continue to use the same class for 2-dimensional points.
class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def translate(self, deltax=0, deltay=0):
        """Translate the point in the x direction by deltax
           and in the y direction by deltay."""
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    бн
Which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the 
Point2D initializer and its translate method? For your first attempt 
at this problem, we suggest that you try to answer without using CodeSkulptor.

point0 = Point2D(2, 5)
point1 = Point2D(8, 3)
point2 = Point2D(0, 2)
points = [point0, point1, point2]
for point in points:
    point.translate(-1, -1)



Question 3
Let's continue to use the same class for 2-dimensional points.

Which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the Point2D 
initializer and its translate method? For your first attempt at this problem,
 we suggest that you try to answer without using CodeSkulptor.

point = Point2D(3, 6)
s = str(point)

Question 4
In SimpleGUI, the function draw_image takes an optional sixth 
parameter that determines the angle of rotation of the destination 
rectangle around its center. Do positive values for the angle rotate 
the image clockwise or counterclockwise? Is the angle specified in degrees or radians?

clockwise, radians

Question 5
One interesting extension of Rice Rocks would be to have two ships,
 with each controlled by a separate player, instead of one single 
 ship. Using the provided class definitions, what is the best way 
 to represent the two ships in this new variant?

Add another call to the Ship constructor, assigning the result to another global variable.
ship1 = Ship(бн)
ship2 = Ship(бн)

Question 6
Which of the following browsers fully support MP3 audio files?
Safari
Chrome

Question 7
Consider a spaceship where the ship's thrusters can accelerate 
the ship by 10 pixels per second for each second that the thrust 
key is held down. If the friction induces a deceleration that is 
10% of the ship's velocity per second, what is the maximal velocity 
of the ship? If you are having trouble, consider writing a short 
program to help understand this problem.

Around 100 pixels per second
